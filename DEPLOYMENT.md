# Deployment Guide - AI Parlay Calculator with Odds Scheduler

## üöÄ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Supabase Database Setup
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Scheduler stats table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS scheduler_stats (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  month VARCHAR(7) UNIQUE NOT NULL, -- Format: "2025-08"
  monthly_usage BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
  daily_usage BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
  quota_target BIGINT DEFAULT 4850000,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Index for fast lookups
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_scheduler_stats_month ON scheduler_stats(month);

-- Insert current month record
INSERT INTO scheduler_stats (month, monthly_usage, daily_usage, quota_target)
VALUES (
  TO_CHAR(NOW(), 'YYYY-MM'),
  0,
  0,
  4850000
) ON CONFLICT (month) DO NOTHING;

-- Quota monitoring view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW quota_dashboard AS
SELECT 
  month,
  monthly_usage,
  quota_target,
  ROUND((monthly_usage::DECIMAL / quota_target) * 100, 2) as usage_percentage,
  quota_target - monthly_usage as remaining_quota,
  daily_usage,
  ROUND(quota_target::DECIMAL / EXTRACT(DAY FROM DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()) + INTERVAL '1 month' - INTERVAL '1 day'), 0) as daily_target,
  ROUND((daily_usage::DECIMAL / (quota_target::DECIMAL / 30)) * 100, 2) as daily_efficiency,
  updated_at
FROM scheduler_stats 
WHERE month = TO_CHAR(NOW(), 'YYYY-MM');
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your deployment platform:

```env
# Required for scheduler

SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Upgraded Odds API
ODDS_API_KEY=your_upgraded_api_key

# Existing variables
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
EMAIL_USER=your_email
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
EMAIL_FROM=your_from_email
```

## üéØ Key Features Being Deployed

### Comprehensive Odds Refresh System
- **Active Window**: 7 AM - 12 AM (17 hours/day)
- **Core Markets**: NFL, NHL, MLB, MLS, UFC every 60 seconds
- **Player Props**: Sport-specific timing (30s NFL Sundays, 60-90s others)
- **EU Region**: Every 5-10 minutes
- **Quota Target**: 4.85M requests/month (97% of 5M plan)

### Smart Cache System
- **Supabase Storage**: All odds cached with optimized TTL
- **5-minute TTL**: Matches Odds API refresh cycle
- **Off-hours Serving**: Cached odds served during 12 AM - 7 AM
- **Auto-cleanup**: Expired entries removed automatically

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/scheduler/control` - Scheduler management
- `GET /api/scheduler/cached-odds` - Retrieve fresh cached odds
- `POST /api/scheduler/control` - Start/stop/force-refresh

## üìä Expected Performance

### Data Volume (Current Test Results)
- **NFL**: 272 games with full sportsbook coverage
- **UFC**: 81 fights across all events
- **NHL**: 21 games with spreads/totals/h2h
- **MLB**: 19-20 games with full markets
- **MLS**: 30 games with comprehensive coverage

### Request Volume Estimates
- **Core Markets**: 14 requests every 60s = 840 requests/hour
- **Player Props**: Variable based on games (est. 200-500/hour during peak)
- **EU Region**: 14 requests every 5-10 minutes = 84-168 requests/hour
- **Total Peak**: ~1,400 requests/hour during active window
- **Daily Target**: ~23,800 requests/day (17 hours active)
- **Monthly Projection**: ~4.7M requests (97% quota utilization)

## üö® Post-Deployment Monitoring

### 1. Verify Scheduler Status
```bash
curl "https://your-domain.com/api/scheduler/control?action=status"
```

Expected response should show:
- `isActive: true` (during 7 AM - 12 AM)
- `jobsRunning: 7` (all scheduled jobs active)
- `efficiency: "X.X%"` (quota utilization)

### 2. Test Core Functionality
```bash
# Test NFL odds retrieval
curl "https://your-domain.com/api/scheduler/cached-odds?sport=NFL&market=h2h&region=us"

# Force refresh (if needed)
curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/scheduler/control" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"command":"force-refresh"}'
```

### 3. Monitor Supabase
Check your Supabase dashboard for:
- `cache_data` table filling with fresh odds
- `scheduler_stats` tracking quota usage
- Query the `quota_dashboard` view for real-time stats

### 4. Quota Monitoring
```sql
-- Run in Supabase to check quota usage
SELECT * FROM quota_dashboard;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Timing Considerations
- Scheduler automatically starts at deployment
- Active window respects server timezone
- EU refreshes may have lower success rates (expected)
- Player props availability varies by sport/season

### Error Handling
- Duplicate key errors during refresh are normal (overlapping cycles)
- Failed API calls are logged but don't stop the scheduler
- Auto-adjustment slows down if quota usage is too high

### Scaling Notes
- System designed for current 5M credit plan
- Will auto-adjust if usage trends high/low
- Can handle multiple concurrent refresh cycles

## üéâ What Users Get

### Immediate Benefits
1. **Fresh Data**: Odds never older than 5 minutes during active hours
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All major sportsbooks for 5 sports
3. **Player Props**: When available, automatically included
4. **24/7 Availability**: Cached odds served during off-hours
5. **High Performance**: Sub-second API responses
6. **Cost Efficiency**: Maximizes your upgraded plan value

### Enhanced Parlay Generation
- More positive EV opportunities with fresh data
- Better arbitrage detection with comprehensive coverage
- Reduced API failures from timeout/rate limits
- Improved success rates for parlay creation

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If Scheduler Isn't Running
```bash
# Check status
curl "https://your-domain.com/api/scheduler/control?action=status"

# Restart if needed
curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/scheduler/control" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"command":"start"}'
```

### If Quota Usage Too High
```bash
# Analyze usage
curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/scheduler/control" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"command":"analyze-quota"}'
```

The system will automatically slow down EU and props refreshes if needed.
